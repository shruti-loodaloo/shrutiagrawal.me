              <p>
                Everything's Amazing(sort of), in this book it is true. This
                book has some tost doodles at the end, I tried making them and
                they worked out well. The book is a great realistic fiction. I
                like the incident that happened in the dog show, and the
                excitement for Tom's dino village party.

                In this book, there are three friends who find a magical
                cookbook while looking around in the attic. They try out the
                recipes in this book to find that they are no ordinary recipes
                but magical ones. I liked the interesting adventures and their
                close friendship. So I will recommend this book to all my
                friends!

                With this book and a comfortable chair to sit in, you can travel
                all around India without flight tickets. I liked the way Supriya
                Sehgal has described the fabulous corners of India that not many
                people decide to visit. While reading this book I felt like was
                standing there in teh place she described.

                I bet that some of you like school and some don't, but if you go
                to Crunchem Hall Elementary school you will definitely not like
                it. The way Matilda teaches Trunchbull a lesson is something
                that always fascinated me. Matilda had support not from her
                family but her school teacher. What she does is a secret read
                and find out.

                I think in all the books you might have read, a giant is always

                or a Big Friendly Giant. Well, he collects memories and has a
                small friend. The best thing about him is that he has a huge
                heart may be bigger than him and is always kind to everyone
                except the mean giants which he helps to defeat.

                Joe, Beth and Franie are moving to the country and to their
                surprise, there are no buzzing cars or buses there. They decide
                to go on a picnic and into the forest. My favorite part is what
                they find there - nothing other than the great faraway tree. At
                first I found it hard to imagine that such a tree could exists,
                but then I remembered that this is a fiction story and things
                like this wont happen in the real world. I hope that you would
                like to read this book and find out what the magic faraway tree
                is all about.

              <span>April 2020</span>
              <p>
                This is a hilarious book full of all the yeses and no and maybes
                of Tom Gates. Tom cant make up his mind most of the times even
                when it comes to doodling, he cant decide what to draw. The best
                part is that he makes his mind the right way when his friends
                are calling him to the park and his grand parents are calling
                him for a surprise. Its a good read if you want to have some fun
                laughing along.

                Joe, Beth and Franie are back this time with their cousin.
                Moonface greats them cheerfully and so does Saucepan Man and the
                others at the Faraway tree. Oh and what an adventure they have,
                getting lost in one of the lands and not being able to come
                back. My favorite bit was when Enid Blyton described the look on
                their cousins face. I t was so funny and unique that I wont been
                have to think of the words he used.

                Willy Wonka has a chocolate factory in which the kids that came
                were all greedy and wanted everything to themselves, but Charlie
                was calm and took only what he was given. As a result of this,
                some of them ended in teh trash, others being stretched, some
                being over flexible and so on. Charlie on the other hand was my
                favorite and in the end he won the chocolate factory all to
                himself. I hope Charlie uses the factory well.

                first it is to hot and then to cold in the end a war snow ball
                war begins between the upper Slury and lowers Slury kids. Greg's
                dad suggests a few tricks which is realy fasinating to read
                about. the most enjoyable part is that inside the book they have
                given how to make our very own snow shooters. I think you should
                give them a shot this winter, and you can read the book for tips
                to win a snow ball war(if one happens in your street)
